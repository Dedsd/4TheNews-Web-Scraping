### Web Scraping with python selecting four news items to keep informed for the day, at the end sends the information as a bot in discord. 

---

## Considerations
* You need to change the token, to match your bot
* You need to change the webdriver section according to your browser and your webdriver
* You have to install the [requirements](#requirements)
* The news are from Brazilian sites and are in Portuguese
* I do not own any rights to the sites, news and images presented, nor am I responsible for any changes made later by someone else

---

## Requirements

* Python in the latest version
* Selenium
* Webdriver for your brownser
* Discord.py


---

## Credits
* Sites that are sources for the news, images, etc: https://www.cnnbrasil.com.br/ and https://www.bbc.com/portuguese
* I would like to thank [Mateus Cavalcanti](https://github.com/Mateus-Cavalcanti) and [yxqsnz](https://github.com/yxqsnz) who helped me solve some very annoying errors
